# Julia on HPC for dummies

A loose collection of notes and example scripts that can be used for running Julia on an HPC. While the Julia examples should be applicable to any HPC, bash scripts may contain some details that are specific to the clusters owned and maintained by [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/).

## Repo Structure

All notes are collected in this README file. Many of them are specific to working on one of the HPCs owned and maintained by [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/). Code examples including Julia scripts and bash scripts (used to submit slurm jobs on clusters) are all contained inside the `examples/` folder. The `Project.toml` file inside the `examples/` folder specifies all necessary package dependencies. Any log files you may find contain the logs for specific examples. 

## Credit

Some of the examples you find here are either inspired or in some cases partially copied from [`MPI.jl`](https://juliaparallel.org/MPI.jl/latest/).

## Cluster-specific Notes

This section contains notes that are specific to the clusters owned and maintained by [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/). While I am affiliated with TU Delft, I am not a cluster administrator but merely a user who primarily works with Julia. 

### Julia on DelftBlue

DelftBlue is one of the high-performance computers accessible to students and employees of TU Delft. It has farily extensive [documentation](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/). The documentation has a helpful [section](https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/howtos/Julia-with-MPI/) dedicated to Julia. The notes below offer additional advice.

#### Self-install

As an alternative to using the software stack, you may want to install Julia from scratch. This makes managing your personalized Julia installation almost as easy as on you own device. This can be done as follows:

1. Follow the instructions in docs for linking scratch spaces to home: https://doc.dhpc.tudelft.nl/delftblue/howtos/Julia-with-MPI/#installing-mpi-package
2. Install `juliaup` as follows: `curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh`.

Then Julia can be run as follows:

```julia
11:20:40 paltmeyer@login04 ~ â†’ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.9.3 (2023-08-24)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |
```

!!! tip "An optional title"
    To avoid running out of memory on your `home/` drive, you may want to move the `juliaup` installation to `scratch`:

    ```
    mkdir -p /scratch/${USER}/.juliaup
    ln -s /scratch/${USER}/.juliaup $HOME/.juliaup
    ```
